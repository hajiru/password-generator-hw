# <Password Generator>

## Description

This password generator application generates a random password according to the user's choices. The application will take in the user's choices through prompts and generate a random password accordingly to the user's choices. This homework assignment helped me understand the use of prompts, eventListeners, and adding selected arrays into one variable with the help of loops.
